## Overview

**Fractal Resonance Cognition (FRC)** is a pioneering framework for complex systems analysis developed by Hadi Servat. FRC introduces novel methodologies for understanding and modeling emergent behaviors across interconnected systems by leveraging principles of fractal geometry, resonance phenomena, and cognitive science.

The FRC framework provides researchers, analysts, and practitioners with tools to:

- Identify and map fractal patterns within complex adaptive systems
- Model resonance effects between system components
- Apply cognitive frameworks to interpret emergent behaviors
- Generate insights across multiple domains including economics, biology, social systems, and technology networks
