  "description": "Analyzes when deviations from |alpha|^2 can appear in the FRC collapse picture: finite locking time, non‑ergodic microstate ensembles, and non‑stationary pointer coupling. Derives simple bias scalings, proposes falsifiable protocols, and includes toy simulations with reproducible figures.",
