  "description": "Derives the Born rule from a resonant equilibrium of microstates in a deterministic collapse model. A small coherence drift biases trajectories toward pointer attractors; the stationary weights are proportional to |alpha|^2. Includes toy simulations, convergence plots, and clear falsification tests.",
