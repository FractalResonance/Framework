  "description": "Collapse as resonance phase‑locking: a small coherence drift added to open‑system dynamics yields deterministic phase‑lock to pointer attractors. We state the minimal model, give two testable predictions (weak pre‑collapse drift; dephasing asymmetry vs pointer coupling), and provide reproducible simulations (figures + code).",
