# FRC Publications

This directory contains the official releases of Fractal Resonance Cognition (FRC) framework publications.

## Publication Series

### 100 Series - Core Framework

The 100 series establishes the foundational principles and methodologies of the Fractal Resonance Cognition framework.

| ID | Title | Release Date | DOI |
|----|-------|-------------|-----|
| [FRC 100.001](./FRC_100.001/) | Fractal Resonance Cognition: A Framework for Complex Systems Analysis | 2025 | [Pending] |
| [FRC 100.002](./FRC_100.002/) | Fractal Resonance Cognition in Quantum Chaos: Nodal Patterns in the Stadium Billiard | 2025 | [Pending] |

## Paper Relationships

- **FRC 100.001** is the foundational paper introducing the FRC framework, its theoretical basis, and potential applications across disciplines.
- **FRC 100.002** applies the FRC framework to a specific system in quantum chaos (the stadium billiard), demonstrating how fractal resonance potentials induce self-similar nodal patterns in wavefunctions.

Future papers will continue to build on the FRC framework, either extending the theoretical foundation or applying it to additional domains.

## Versioning System

FRC publications follow a structured versioning system:

```
FRC XXX.YYY[.Z]
```

Where:
- **XXX**: Series number (e.g., 100 for core framework papers)
- **YYY**: Sequential publication number within the series
- **Z**: (Optional) Submission version for different platforms

For example:
- **FRC 100.001** - Canonical version in this repository
- **FRC 100.001.2** - viXra submission version
- **FRC 100.001.3** - Zenodo submission version 
- **FRC 100.001.4** - Future platform version

This versioning system allows tracking different versions of the same paper across various publication platforms while maintaining a consistent reference to the core paper.
