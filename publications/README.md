## Paper Relationships

- **FRC 100.001** is the foundational paper introducing the FRC framework, its theoretical basis, and potential applications across disciplines. It has been published on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15073056).

- **FRC 100.002** applies the FRC framework to a specific system in quantum chaos (the stadium billiard), demonstrating how fractal resonance potentials induce self-similar nodal patterns in wavefunctions. It has been published on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15079278) and references FRC 100.001 through the "Related works" field.

- **FRC 100.003** extends the framework to quantum measurement, proposing that wavefunction collapse follows structured pathways guided by resonant attractor states in phase space. It has been published on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15079820) and builds on both FRC 100.001 and FRC 100.002, addressing the quantum measurement problem through the lens of fractal resonance.

Future papers will continue to build on the FRC framework, either extending the theoretical foundation or applying it to additional domains.

## Versioning System

FRC publications follow a structured versioning system:

```
FRC XXX.YYY[.Z]
```

Where:
- **XXX**: Series number (e.g., 100 for core framework papers)
- **YYY**: Sequential publication number within the series
- **Z**: (Optional) Submission version for different platforms

For example:
- **FRC 100.001** - Canonical version in this repository
- **FRC 100.001.2** - viXra submission version
- **FRC 100.001.3** - Zenodo submission version (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15073056)
- **FRC 100.001.4** - Future platform version
- **FRC 100.002.3** - Zenodo submission version (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15079278)
- **FRC 100.003.3** - Zenodo submission version (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15079820)

This versioning system allows tracking different versions of the same paper across various publication platforms while maintaining a consistent reference to the core paper.
