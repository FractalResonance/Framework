## Abstract

We introduce Fractal Resonance Cognition (FRC), a pioneering theoretical framework designed to analyze complex systems across diverse domains, including quantum physics, biology, and cosmology. FRC proposes that complex systems are governed by vortex-like attractor structures with fractal scaling and resonant dynamics, manifesting as self-similar patterns in spatial, spectral, or temporal properties.

We define the FRC operator, a mathematical construct that encodes fractal resonance, and demonstrate its application through a 1D harmonic oscillator perturbed by a fractal potential, revealing the emergence of self-similar resonant modes. FRC suggests that apparent randomness in complex systems arises from deterministic, self-similar resonant interactions, providing a unified perspective on complexity.

We explore potential applications in quantum chaos, atomic and molecular spectra, neural dynamics, and cosmological structures, identifying key experimental signatures such as fractal dimensions (D∼1.5–2.0), harmonic energy intervals, and power-law correlations. Experimental strategies, including high-harmonic spectroscopy and microwave cavity experiments, are proposed to test FRC's predictions.

By emphasizing fractal resonance as a fundamental organizing principle, FRC bridges disciplines and invites collaboration to explore its interdisciplinary potential.
