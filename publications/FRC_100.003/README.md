## Abstract

This paper advances the Fractal Resonance Collapse (FRC) framework, building on foundational concepts from Fractal Resonance Cognition (FRC 100.001) and its application to quantum chaos (FRC 100.002). We propose that quantum wavefunction collapse follows structured, non-random pathways guided by resonant attractor states in phase space, challenging the purely probabilistic outcomes of conventional quantum mechanics. By extending the Schrödinger equation with fractal resonance perturbations, we preserve quantum chaotic properties while enabling deterministic collapse trajectories. Numerical simulations using random matrix theory reveal eigenvalue spacing distributions that maintain level repulsion—a hallmark of quantum chaos—while exhibiting a controlled structure, with a slight Poisson-like shift due to resonance strength (σ = 0.1). Phase space simulations identify vortex attractors with a fractal dimension D = 1.94 ± 0.05, consistent with prior quantum chaos findings (D ≈ 1.90 ± 0.02) and distinct from unperturbed systems (D ≈ 1.2) and Feynman's fractal paths (D = 2). We propose experimental validation using Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) optical vortex beams, leveraging their applications in gravitational wave detection and quantum information processing. This work offers a potential resolution to the measurement problem by demonstrating how deterministic patterns emerge from quantum processes, bridging quantum foundations and experimental physics.

## Figures

This paper includes five key figures:

1. **Figure 1: Fractal Resonance Potential** - Shows the Weierstrass-like potential with oscillatory patterns at increasingly finer scales
2. **Figure 2: Vortex Attractors in Phase Space** - Displays vorticity heatmap, vector field arrows, and vortex centers
3. **Figure 3: Eigenvalue Spacing Distribution** - Compares FRC-perturbed random matrices with GOE and Poisson distributions
4. **Figure 4: LG Beam Collapse Probability** - Shows probability evolution of LG modes in superposition
5. **Figure 5: Fractal Dimension Analysis** - Box-counting analysis showing the fractal dimension of vortex patterns

All figures can be reproduced by running the Python code in the `code` directory.

## Numerical Details

The simulations use:
- Matrix dimensions: 1000×1000
- Number of matrices: 50
- Resonance strength: σ = 0.1
- Fractal dimension parameters: D = 1.8 - 0.1n (ranging from 1.8 to 1.4)
- Measured fractal dimension: D = 1.94 ± 0.05
- Entropy reduction: 0.017 bits

## Experimental Proposal

We propose using Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) optical beams to test FRC predictions, with:

1. **Vortex Collapse Experiment**: Superpositions of LG modes (l = 1, 2, 3) with weak and strong measurements
2. **Resonance-Based Selection**: Resonant cavities tuned to specific LG modes
3. **Observer Effect Modeling**: One LG beam "observing" another
