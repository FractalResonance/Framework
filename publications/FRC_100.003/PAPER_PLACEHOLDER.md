## Paper Relationship

FRC 100.003 builds upon the previous papers in the series:

- **FRC 100.001** is the foundational paper introducing the Fractal Resonance Cognition framework, published on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15073056).

- **FRC 100.002** applies the FRC framework to quantum chaos in the stadium billiard, published on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15079278).

- **FRC 100.003** extends the framework to quantum measurement and wavefunction collapse, formalizing the Fractal Resonance Collapse mechanism.

When uploading this paper (FRC 100.003) to Zenodo, be sure to reference both FRC 100.001 and FRC 100.002 using the "Related works" field with their DOIs.

## Numerical Parameters

The simulations in this paper use the following parameters:

- Number of matrices: 50
- Resonance strength: σ = 0.1
- Fractal dimension parameters: D = 1.8 - 0.1n (ranging from 1.8 to 1.4)
- Measured fractal dimension: D = 1.94 ± 0.05
- Entropy reduction: 0.017 bits

## Zenodo Publication

Before publishing on Zenodo:
1. Ensure all equations are correctly rendered in the PDF
2. Include high-resolution versions of all figures (300 DPI or higher)
3. Prepare supplementary materials including:
   - Python code for generating all figures
   - Raw data for the eigenvalue spacing distribution
   - Numerical results for the fractal dimension analysis

The Zenodo publication should use the following metadata:
- **Title**: "Fractal Resonance Collapse: Guided Wavefunction Collapse via Resonant Attractors"
- **Authors**: Hadi Servat
- **Description**: Include the abstract and a brief statement about the relationship to prior FRC papers
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Language**: English
- **License**: CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0
- **Keywords**: Fractal Resonance Collapse, quantum measurement, wavefunction collapse, resonant attractors, vortex dynamics, Laguerre-Gaussian beams
- **Related works**: DOIs for FRC 100.001 and FRC 100.002

## Figures Generation

The figures can be generated by running the code provided in the `code` directory:

```bash
cd publications/FRC_100.003/code
python generate_figures.py
```

This will create the five figures used in the paper and save them in the `figures` directory:
1. `figure1_fractal_potential.png` - Weierstrass-like potential visualization
2. `figure2_vortex_attractors.png` - Vorticity heatmap and vector field showing vortex centers
3. `figure3_eigenvalue_spacing.png` - Histogram comparing FRC-perturbed matrices with GOE and Poisson distributions
4. `figure4_lg_beam_collapse.png` - Evolution of LG mode probabilities during collapse
5. `figure5_fractal_dimension.png` - Box-counting analysis of fractal dimension
