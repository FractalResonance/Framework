Once uploaded, this placeholder file can be removed.

## Paper Relationship

FRC 100.002 builds upon FRC 100.001, the foundational paper in the series. It demonstrates practical application of the FRC framework to a specific quantum chaotic system, the stadium billiard.

When uploading to external platforms like Zenodo, make sure to reference FRC 100.001 properly. After both papers are published, update the DOI references to establish the formal relationship between the papers.

## Figures Generation

The figures can be generated by running the code provided in the `code` directory:

```bash
cd publications/FRC_100.002/code
python stadium_billiard.py
```

This will create the two figures used in the paper and save them in the `figures` directory.
