## Abstract

We apply the Fractal Resonance Cognition (FRC) framework to quantum chaos, focusing on the stadium billiard—a paradigmatic system exhibiting chaotic dynamics. FRC posits that complex systems are governed by vortex-like attractor structures with fractal scaling and resonant dynamics, manifesting as self-similar patterns. Here, we explore how a fractal resonance potential, encoded via the FRC operator, influences the nodal patterns of wavefunctions in the stadium billiard. 

Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the FRC potential induces self-similar nodal structures, with fractal dimensions D ≈ 1.90 ± 0.02, consistent with FRC's predictions of resonant, scale-invariant dynamics. Figure 1 illustrates the nodal patterns, showing fractal clustering, while Figure 2 quantifies the fractal dimension via box-counting analysis. Figure 3 visualizes the FRC potential itself, highlighting its fractal structure within the stadium domain. These findings support FRC's hypothesis that apparent randomness in complex systems arises from deterministic fractal resonance, offering a new perspective on quantum chaos.

## Figures

This paper includes three key figures:

1. **Figure 1: Nodal Patterns** - Shows nodal lines of the 15th eigenfunction in the unperturbed and perturbed stadium billiard
2. **Figure 2: Fractal Dimension Analysis** - Box-counting analysis showing the fractal dimension of the perturbed system (D ≈ 1.90 ± 0.02) compared to unperturbed (D ≈ 1.2)
3. **Figure 3: FRC Potential Visualization** - Visualization of the Weierstrass-like fractal resonance potential within the stadium domain

All figures can be reproduced by running the Python code in the `code` directory.

## Numerical Details

The simulations use:
- Grid resolution: 150×150 points
- Stadium dimensions: L = 2 (straight sides), R = 1 (semicircular ends)
- Eigenfunction: 15th eigenstate (from 20 computed eigenvalues)
- FRC potential parameters: σ = 0.1, λ = 2, α = 0.6, N = 4, kx = 8, ky = 12
